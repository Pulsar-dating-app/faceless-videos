# Voice Samples

This folder contains pre-recorded voice samples for preview purposes.

To add your voice samples:
1. Generate a short sample (5-10 seconds) for each voice using OpenAI's TTS
2. Save them as: alloy.mp3, echo.mp3, fable.mp3, onyx.mp3, nova.mp3, shimmer.mp3
3. Use a simple text like "Hello! This is a preview of how this voice sounds for your video."

You only need to generate these samples ONCE and they will be reused for all customers.
